What is Arcanidite?

Arcanidite is the name of our brand.
Arcanidite 'shores' is a wiki-like community platform for the game Brighter Shores.
I, ScriptPunk (BS ign), started this website as a tribute to Zybez, a RuneScape fansite that was a big part of my childhood.
Curse bought out Zybez.net gobbled it up, and transmogged it into fandom wiki. :\
So, as a way to compete against Curse, I started Arcanidite. ^^
